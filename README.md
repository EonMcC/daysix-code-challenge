# Daysix Code Challenge

## Notes
- The app currently assumes the user is a female called Jane. If the app was to become functional, then I would have a user context that would handle name and sex etc. The rating would then be dynamically set accordingly.

I hope the codebase makes sense on it's own and that it is easy to follow, however, I am happy to answer any questions should they arise.
